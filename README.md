# ML_HousingPricePredictionModel
This project focuses on predicting housing pricing by utilizing machine learning models with the help of dataset from Kaggle, namely California housing prices. The data set was processed accordingly, trained and analyzed to get results. Feature Engineering was also added to gain understanding of data. Visualization using histogram, scatterplot etc helps analyze the data. This project is extremely beginner friendly with clear process division and short notes.

Linear regression, Random Forest were chosen as models to train and evaluate. Hyperparameters were also added to see for better outcome. The goal is to identify the best suitable model with the help of scores. Linear regression gives a score of 0.653703883, Random Forest 0.766177611 and using Grid Search, score of 0.766768403 gotten.

Thus, though Grid Search gives highest scores, with a 0.0006 score difference with Random Forest Regressor, the wait time may not be worthy. We might get better results by using a different variety of hyperparameters for Grid Search technique.
